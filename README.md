# TDLabs - Tower Defense Game
>Currently in development.
---
This is a personal project of mine that I use as a hobby in the field of game development using skills such as the C# programming language and the [Unity](https://unity.com) tool.

## What is this game about?
This game is a [Tower Defense Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_defense), set in a fictional laboratory named *Artean Laboratories Inc*.

The main story behind the game is that this private lab company is testing weapons with the goal of enhancing their product to achieve higher success.

## Notes
- This is my first relatively big game development project, so I'm not trying to create the perfect game, just something.
- All of the game assets are created by me.

Any feedback is always welcome!
