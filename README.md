# TDLabs - Tower Defense Game
>Currently in development.
---
This is a personal project of mine that I use as a hobby in the field of game development using skills such as the C# programming language and the [Unity](https://unity.com) tool.

## What is this game about?
This game is a [Tower Defense Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_defense), set in a fictional laboratory named *Artean Laboratories Inc*.

The main story behind the game is that this private lab company is testing weapons with the goal of enhancing their product to achieve higher success.

## Some pictures of the game

### Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment
  - To create a dynamic experience for each round of the game, I was inspired by this astonishing article: **"[Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment in Tower Defense](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/2a568c9c-4059-4606-b520-9d6fa60b9d52/dynamic-difficulty-adjustment-in-tower-defence.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%2F20230206%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20230206T133323Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-Signature=1a2e2112712bfa71d15937247dee9fed6dd49a29b8cdfe486f5187c97ac3386a&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&response-content-disposition=filename%3D%22dynamic-difficulty-adjustment-in-tower-defence.pdf%22&x-id=GetObject)"** by *Rhio Sutoyoa, Davies Winataa, Katherine Oliviania, Dedy Martadinata Supriyadia ; Bina Nusantara University, Jl.

## Notes
- This is my first relatively big game development project, so I'm not trying to create the perfect game, just something.
- All of the game assets are created by me.

Any feedback is always welcome!
